This is a full-stack web application built using Nest.js with TypeORM and MySQL for the backend, 
and React with Material UI for the frontend. 
The application is Dockerized for easy deployment and running.

To run the app type npm run start

Explanation why the chosen approach is used:

Backend (Nest.js with TypeORM and MySQL):
Pros:

Nest.js:
Modularity: Nest.js provides a modular structure, making it easy to organize code and maintainability.
Dependency Injection: It offers built-in support for dependency injection, facilitating code reusability and testing.
Scalability: Nest.js is designed with scalability in mind, allowing seamless scaling of applications as they grow.
TypeORM:
Type Safety: TypeORM provides type safety for database interactions, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): ORM simplifies database operations by allowing developers to work with objects instead of raw SQL queries.
Cross-Platform Support: TypeORM supports multiple database systems, providing flexibility in choosing the database backend.
MySQL:
Performance: MySQL is known for its high performance, making it suitable for applications with high transaction volumes.
Reliability: MySQL is a mature and widely-used database system, known for its reliability and robustness.
Community Support: It has a large community of users and developers, providing ample resources and support.
Cons:

Learning Curve: Learning Nest.js and TypeORM may require some time, especially for developers who are new to TypeScript or ORM concepts.
Complexity: As the application grows, managing complex Nest.js modules and TypeORM entities can become challenging.
Deployment Complexity: Deploying applications using Nest.js and MySQL may require additional setup compared to simpler frameworks or databases.
Frontend (React with Material UI):
Pros:

React:
Component-Based: React's component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability of UI code.
Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM ensures efficient rendering, resulting in better performance.
Large Ecosystem: React has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, providing solutions for various frontend development needs.
Material UI:
Design Consistency: Material UI offers pre-designed components following Google's Material Design guidelines, ensuring a consistent and polished UI.
Customization: It allows easy customization of components to fit specific design requirements.
Community Support: Material UI has an active community and extensive documentation, making it easy to find solutions to common issues.
Cons:

Performance Overhead: Material UI's extensive styling and theming options may introduce some performance overhead, especially in complex applications.
Learning Curve: Learning React and Material UI requires time and effort, particularly for developers who are new to component-based UI development or CSS-in-JS approaches.
Browser Compatibility: Material UI's components may not always render consistently across different browsers, requiring additional testing and tweaking for cross-browser compatibility.
Conclusion:
Pros of the Stack:
The chosen stack combines powerful backend technologies like Nest.js, TypeORM, and MySQL with popular frontend tools like React and Material UI, offering a robust and feature-rich development environment.
The stack provides a good balance between performance, scalability, and developer productivity, making it suitable for a wide range of web applications.
Cons of the Stack:
Developers should be prepared to invest time in learning and mastering the technologies involved, especially considering the potential complexity of managing both the backend and frontend aspects of the application.
While the stack offers great flexibility and power, it may not be the best choice for small or simple projects due to the learning curve and setup overhead.

Assumptions possible during code operation:

Assumptions:
Stable Database Connection: The code assumes a stable connection to the MySQL database. Any network issues or database server downtime could disrupt the application's functionality.

Consistent Data Format: The backend assumes consistent data format and structure from the frontend. Any inconsistencies or unexpected data could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Adequate Error Handling: The code assumes that error handling mechanisms are in place both on the backend and frontend to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

Proper Environment Configuration: The application relies on environment variables for configuration, such as database connection details and API URLs. Incorrect or missing configuration could lead to runtime errors.

Validations and Security: The application assumes proper input validations on both frontend and backend to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Potential Issues:
Database Connection Errors: The application may encounter database connection errors due to network issues, database server overload, or misconfiguration. Proper error handling and retries may be necessary to mitigate these issues.

Data Integrity Issues: In a multi-user environment, concurrent database operations could lead to data integrity issues such as race conditions or inconsistent state. Proper transaction management and locking mechanisms may be needed to address these issues.

Performance Bottlenecks: As the application grows, performance bottlenecks may arise, especially in database-intensive operations. Optimization techniques such as indexing, caching, or query optimization may be necessary to maintain acceptable performance levels.

Security Vulnerabilities: The application may be vulnerable to security threats such as SQL injection, CSRF attacks, or authentication bypass if proper security measures are not implemented. Regular security audits and updates are essential to address these vulnerabilities.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Issues: If the frontend and backend are hosted on different domains, CORS issues may arise, preventing the frontend from accessing the backend API. Proper CORS configuration on the server side is necessary to allow cross-origin requests.

Browser Compatibility: The frontend may experience compatibility issues with certain browsers or versions, leading to inconsistent rendering or functionality. Thorough testing on different browsers and devices is required to ensure compatibility.

Dependency Vulnerabilities: The application may be susceptible to security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Regular dependency scanning and updates are crucial to address these vulnerabilities.
